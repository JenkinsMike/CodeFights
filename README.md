Kotlin Solutions for CodeFights

## Purpose
On occasion, I found myself stuck while bounding my way thru learning Kotlin via CodeFights.
I found it very helpful to jump on Github and look at what other people did as solutions in thair language and apply it to how I was teaching myself Kotlin.
It was very helpful and helped me apply principles and logic in effort to come to a solution.  The only thing that could have been more helpful would have been to find .kt solutions.

With that in mind, here are my solutions.

### Notes
* I am a novice.  Or, at least, I stated out as one.
* The [Completion Weeks](https://github.com/JenkinsMike/CodeFights/blob/master/Completion%20Weeks.md) file in this repository will include the calendar weeks in which I completed these tasks such that it can slightly explain why some of my solutions aren't the best or most idiomatic.
